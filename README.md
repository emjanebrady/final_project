DAPII Final Project

**The datasets**
Both datasets are included in this repository, but more information about each can be found below.

The first dataset comes from Georgia Department of Community Supervision, Georgia Crime Information Center. It was provided publicly as a challenge to see if analysts could forecast recidivism based on risk fastors.

The second dataset comes from a state-wide sample of Florida juveniles who completed probation supervision between 2015 and 2018. The study examines trajectories of risk and protective factors throughout probation supervision, whether such trajectories affect the likelihood of recidivism, and how community context influences those relationships.
